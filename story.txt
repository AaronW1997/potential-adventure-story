It was a cold winter day when John got up for work. He went through his
morning routine just like any other day. Little did John know, he was in
for a surprise that day. When John walked out of his apartment and on to the
street a snowball went flying right past his face! 

It was John's sister Ann, she was there to give him a ride to work. "Sorry about
that, I just had to. Lastnight's snowfall is perfect for snowballs, especially ones 
to the face!" She said as she made a smirk. John, now fully awake and alert desided to
return the favor.
