It was a cold winter day when John got up for work. He went through his
morning routine just like any other day. Little did John know, he was in
for a surprise that day. When John walked out of his apartment and on to the
street a snowball went flying right past his face! 

It was John's sister Ann, she was there to give him a ride to work. "Sorry about
that, I just had to. Lastnight's snowfall is perfect for snowballs, especially ones 
to the face!" She said as she made a smirk. John, now fully awake and alert desided to
return the favor.

John invited her sister inside his apartment. He told his sister that he was going to 
order cake since it is her birthday. Once the cake arrived, John smiled knowing he
wanted to return the favor. He told his sister to make a wish even though there were no 
candles. Ann was starting to get a little suspicious with John's actions.
