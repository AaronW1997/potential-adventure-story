It was a cold winter day when John got up for work. He went through his
morning routine just like any other day. Little did John know, he was in
for a surprise that day. When John walked out of his apartment and on to the
street a snowball went flying right past his face! 

It was John's sister Ann, she was there to give him a ride to work. "Sorry about
that, I just had to. Lastnight's snowfall is perfect for snowballs, especially ones 
to the face!" She said as she made a smirk. John, now fully awake and alert desided to
return the favor.

John invited her sister inside his apartment. He told his sister that he was going to 
order cake since it is her birthday. Once the cake arrived, John smiled knowing he
wanted to return the favor. He told his sister to make a wish even though there were no 
candles. Ann was starting to get a little suspicious with John's actions.

"What are you looking at me like that for? It's not a trick." said John pretty suspiciously.
Ann thought about it for a second then suddenly she pushed the cake onto the floor and 
ducked. She waited for a moment. Then another moment. She slowly leaned over and peered 
cautiously at the cake. It was a regular cake. What? She looked at John, whose face was 
frozen in shock. "Why did you you that?" he asked. "I mean I  bought your  least favorite
cake flavor, but other than that I actually had no other tricks."

"Oh my gosh I thought you were messing with me!" said Ann. "It's your birthday Ann would I
mess with you?" asked John, "But don't worry, I had a feeling this would happen." John brought
out another cake with candle and told Ann to blow them out for her birthday. As Ann leaned in to
blow them out, John pushed her face right in to the cake. "GOTCHA!" proclaimed John as he laughed...
his plan worked out.
